- add to settings.json template: typescript.preferences.preferTypeOnlyAutoImports
  - https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-3-rc/#optimizations-by-skipping-jsdoc-parsing

- lint rule: if return type of function includes undefined in a union, don't allow void return

- investigate array vs set performance (also search for "O(1)" afterward)

- use stack overflow to remove isaac-typescript-definitions from deps
  - difficult, do it when I have the courage
  - make sure that isaacscript-common still works through link in dev

- wait for CodePath PR to be accepted: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/pull/7551
  - then use upstream CodePath

- wait for eslint-plugin-n to fix rule:
  - https://github.com/eslint-community/eslint-plugin-n/issues/134
  - if this takes too long, we can make a new ESLint rule to automatically convert 'import *.js";' to '.ts'
  - the idea here is to have IsaacScript mods use ".ts" file extensions instead of ".js"
    - blocked on: https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua/issues/1514
  - for Node.js apps, we don't want to force the use of a bundler such as ESBuild, so they will remain having ".js" file extensions

- wait for typedoc-plugin-markdown to release next version: https://github.com/tgreyuk/typedoc-plugin-markdown/discussions/372

- update eslint to new config
  - wait until ESLint 9 is released so that environment flag is not necessary
  - wait until @typescript-eslint/plugin is using flat config and has good docs
  - ESLint does not support "eslint.config.mjs" file format, so it requires either:
    1. changing package.json type
    2. specifying config file location when running, e.g. "--config eslint.config.mjs"
